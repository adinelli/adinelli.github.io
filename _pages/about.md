PhD student in the <a
href='https://sites.google.com/view/theory-of-complex-systems/welcome?authuser=0'>theory
group</a> of the MSC lab, working under the supervision of Professor <a
href='https://physics.mit.edu/faculty/julien-tailleur/'>Julien
Tailleur</a>.

My main research interest is theoretical statistical physics, in
particular with applications to biology. For my PhD work, I am
studying the self-organization of heterogeneous living systems, such
as bacterial ecosystems. To do so, I am using the tools of active
matter, which describes out-of-equilibrium systems of self-propelling
units. On the one hand, I try to derive analytical descriptions of
these systems by coarse-graining their microscopic dynamics into
corresponding large-scale field theories. On the other hand, I perform
particle-based simulations of these models to test the validity of the
analytical predictions.
