PhD student in the <a
href='https://sites.google.com/view/theory-of-complex-systems/welcome?authuser=0'>theory
group</a> of the MSC lab, working under the supervision of Professor <a
href='https://physics.mit.edu/faculty/julien-tailleur/'>Julien
Tailleur</a>.

My main research interest is theoretical statistical physics, in
particular with applications to biology. For my PhD work, I am
studying the self-organization of heterogeneous living systems, such
as bacterial ecosystems. From a physical point of view, motile
bacteria can be described as <span style="color:
var(--global-theme-color)"> active particles</span>, i.e. microscopic
units that can exert self-propulsion forces on the environment.

On the one hand, I try to derive analytical descriptions of these
systems by <span style="color:
var(--global-theme-color)">coarse-graining</span> their microscopic
dynamics into corresponding large-scale field theories. On the other
hand, I perform <span style="color:
var(--global-theme-color)">particle-based simulations</span> of these
models to test the validity of the analytical predictions.
